# HW01-Accessibility
## Description
I refactored existing code to meet accessiblity standards, which allows the site to be optimized for search engines.

## Project Action Steps
- I updated the site to meet accessibility standards 
- I added semantic HTML elements to the site
- I confirmed the elements follow a logical structure
- I added accessible alt attributes to the icon and image elements
- I confirmed the heading attributes fall in sequential order
- I added a concise, descriptive title
