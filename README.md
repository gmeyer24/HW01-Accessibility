# HW01-Horiseon-Meeting-Accessibility-Standards
## Description
I refactored existing code to meet accessiblity standards, which allows the site to be optimized for search engines.

## Project Action Steps
- I updated the site to meet accessibility standards. 
- I added semantic HTML elements to the site.
- I confirmed the elements follow a logical structure.
- I added accessible alt attributes to the icon and image elements.
- I confirmed the heading attributes fall in sequential order.
- I added a concise, descriptive title. 
- I edited and confirmed all application links function correctly.
- I consolidated and organized the application's CSS selectors and properties to follow semantic structure.
- I included comments on the application's CSS file for the changes I made.
